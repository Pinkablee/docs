title: Asset Escrow
---

The **Asset Escrow System**, a collaboration between [Cfx.re](https://cfx.re/) and [Tebex](https://www.tebex.io/), offers a practical solution to obfuscation and IP locking. By ensuring ownership upon purchase, your content can only run on your customers' servers, safeguarding it from unauthorized use. Moreover, your resources will be encrypted to prevent leaks of your work.

### How it Functions

- Designed for developers selling resources for FiveM, the asset escrow system safeguards their code against leaks or theft.
- The system encrypts chosen files within a resource, designating them as an "asset," making these files no longer viewable or editable.
- Authentication of assets is tied to a server's license key from the cfx keymaster.
- When a user launches the resource on their server, the server's license key is checked to ensure that the FiveM account owning the key matches the account owning the asset.
- Upon purchasing a script/resource from Tebex, this "asset" is granted to the buyer's FiveM account. To authenticate and use the resource, their server must use a license key generated under the same account.

### Essential Details

To purchase a resource from our Tebex store, you'll need to log in using your FiveM and Discord accounts before proceeding.
The resource will be tied to the FiveM account you use for login.
Therefore, when buying a script from our Tebex store, log in with the FiveM account that owns the license key your server uses. <br/>
You can view, download, and transfer your owned assets through the cfx.re keymaster, accessible via this link: <br/>
