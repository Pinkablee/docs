### cfg.blocks
The cfg.blocks value must be a table, where each entry represents a gang block configuration. Gang blocks are used to define specific areas associated with a gang. Each gang block configuration should be a table and must include the following parameters:

- **label (string):** This is the displayed label for the gang block.
- **color (number):** The color code for the gang block.
- **radius (number):** The radius of the gang block.
- **blipLabel (string):** The label for the map blip associated with the gang block.
- **blipSprite (number):** The sprite ID for the map blip.
- **blipColor (number):** The color code for the map blip.
- **zoneSize (number):** The size of the zone.
- **markerColor (table):** This is a table that includes RGB color values for the marker.
- **coords (vec3):** The coordinates (x, y, z) that define the location of the gang block.

Each of these parameters is required to define a gang block. Ensure that each entry in the cfg.blocks table adheres to this structure for your gang block configurations.
