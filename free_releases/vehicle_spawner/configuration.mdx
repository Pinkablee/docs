### Locations
The locations value must be a table, and each entry within it represents a spawn location for vehicles. Each entry is itself a table with three required values:

1. marker (number): The in-game marker where players can interact to spawn a vehicle.
2. vehicleSpawn (number): The location where the vehicle will appear when selected.
3. heading (number): The direction or heading in which the spawned vehicle will be oriented.

### Vehicles
The vehicles value must be a table, and each entry within it represents a vehicle model that can be spawned. Each entry is itself a table with two required values:

1. label (string): The text to be displayed in the menu for selecting the vehicle.
2. model (string): The model name of the vehicle to spawn when selected.
