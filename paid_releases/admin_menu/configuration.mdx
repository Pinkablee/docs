### Discord Bot Token
> Enter the bot token of a Discord bot that is in your server. The bot must have permissions to view members and roles. This field is required.

### Discord Guild ID
> Provide the Guild ID of your Discord server where the bot resides. Ensure that the Guild ID matches the one your bot is a member of. This field is required.

### Discord Roles
> Define player permissions based on Discord roles. This is achieved by configuring a table with each role as a separate table. Players with specific roles in your Discord server will receive the corresponding permissions.
