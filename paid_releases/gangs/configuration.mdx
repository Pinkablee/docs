Set the time (in seconds) it takes to capture a turf war zone. This defines how long players need to control a zone to capture it.
```lua cfg.lua
cfg.captureTime = 180 -- (type: number)
```

Define the cooldown time (in seconds) before the same turf war zone can be captured again. This prevents frequent captures.
```lua cfg.lua
cfg.captureCooldownTime = 300 -- (type: number)
```

Specify the time (in seconds) after which an empty turf war zone is automatically canceled. This helps keep the gameplay dynamic.
```lua cfg.lua
cfg.emptyZoneCancelTime = 30 -- (type: number)
```

Choose whether to display a zone capture circle on the map. Enable or disable this feature based on your preferences.
```lua cfg.lua
cfg.displayZoneCircle = true -- (type: boolean)
```

Determine if there is a maximum limit on the number of zones that can be captured simultaneously. Enable or disable this limit.
```lua cfg.lua
cfg.maxSimultaneousZones = true -- (type: boolean)
```

Decide whether to enable the display of gang and rank information on players' screens. Customize this to enhance the player experience.
```lua cfg.lua
cfg.enableHUDInformation = true -- (type: boolean)
```

Configure the strike system. Enable or disable strikes, set the maximum number of strikes, and optionally disable strike management.
```lua cfg.lua
cfg.strikeSystem = {
    enabled = true,
    maxStrikes = 3,
    strikeManagement = true
} -- (type: table)
```

Set the color of the marker used to indicate turf war zones. Customize the color to match your server's theme.
```lua cfg.lua
cfg.marker = {
    color = {red = 255, green = 0, blue = 0, alpha = 100}
} -- (type: table)
```

Define the locations for gang management areas where specific actions related to gangs take place
```lua cfg.lua
cfg.management = {
    {coords = vec3(-1266.956665, -3012.985596, -47.490181)}
} -- (type: table)
```

Customize the messages used in the Turf Wars system. Adjust messages for zone capture, match ties, successful captures, and more.
```lua cfg.lua
cfg.language = {
    canceled = 'The capture of {ZONE} has been canceled due to lack of participants.',
    tie = 'The match in {ZONE} has resulted in a tie, with no winners this time..',
    captured = '{ZONE} has been captured by {WINNER}! Rewards: {AMOUNT}',
    started = '{ZONE} is currently under capture and will conclude in {TIME}.'
} -- (type: table)
```

Configure turf war zones, including their names, locations, alternate locations, labels, capture distances, and associated rewards
```lua cfg.lua
cfg.zones = {
    ['Legion Square'] = {
        coords = vec3(197.350174, -935.668274, 31.686773),
        teleport = vec3(231.571213, -959.170471, 30.330795),
        label = 'Legion Square',
        distance = 100.0,
        rewards = {
            ['cash'] = 0,
            ['dcash'] = 300000
        }
    }
} -- (type: table)
```

Understand how the ChatMessage function is used to send chat messages with a custom chat template
```lua cfg.lua
function ChatMessage(msg)
    TriggerClientEvent('chat:addMessage', -1, {
        template = nil,
        args = { msg }
    })
end -- (type: function)
```
