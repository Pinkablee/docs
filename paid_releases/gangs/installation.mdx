## Getting Started

1. Download the "p-gangs.zip" archive and extract the folder into your server's resources directory.

2. Open your "server.cfg" file and start the resource by adding ensure p-gangs.

3. Inside the "p-gangs" resource folder, you will find a file named "config.lua".

4. Open the "config.lua" file and configure the script to your preferences. For detailed configuration instructions, please refer to the **[Configuration Guide](./configuration.mdx)**.

5. Once you have completed configuring the "config.lua" file, start your server to allow the script to initialize. If any errors are displayed in the console, carefully read them to identify and resolve any issues before seeking further assistance.

**If everything is working properly, your Gangs script is ready to use!**
