## Getting Started

1. Download the resource from keymaster, extract the folder, and place it into your server's resources folder.

2. Inside the p-queue resource, open the "config.lua" file.

3. Configure the queue system to match your server's requirements by following the steps in the **Configuration Guide**.

4. Open your server.cfg file and add "ensure p-queue" to start the resource.

5. Remove any previous queue resources that you were using on your server.

7. Start your server and verify that p-queue is active and functioning. If you encounter any issues open a ticket on our Discord server.

8. If everything is working properly, you are good to go!
